# QUEUE

In Dequeuing there is not much difference in perfomance between array and linked lists 
But when Enqueue there is big difference array is 4 times faster

# Stack

Pop for both array and linked list there is no much difference in performance 
Push big difference Array is 4 times faster than linked list

# Summary 
Looks like stack and queue using Array is faster but queue is fixed size opposite to liked list which has no limits but is slower
